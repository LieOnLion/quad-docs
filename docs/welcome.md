## What is a Quad?

Quad is a mod that adds functional tags for items, blocks and enchantments to Minecraft.

These tags range from what blocks make cats want to sit on, to what enchantments protect you from burning on Magma Blocks, to even adding Ender Masks.

Now coming to Quad is custom Datapack API's with Data Driven Systems. For now only 2 exist: 
- [#Block Replacements](/data-systems/block-replacement) - lets you replace any block in a specified structure with another block
- [#Point(s) of Interest](/data-systems/point-of-interest) - Point(s) of Interest are (mostly) used for Villager Trader Type blocks
