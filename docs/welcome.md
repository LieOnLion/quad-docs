## What is a Quad?

Quad is a mod that adds functional tags for items, blocks and enchantments to Minecraft.

These tags range from what blocks make Cats want to sit on, to what enchantments protect you from burning on Magma Blocks, to even adding Ender Masks.

## How to use Quad

Learn how to use Quad to its fullest with [#Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started).

You can see the full list of tags here at [#List of Tags](/docs/getting-stared/list-of-tags).

For a more in-depth look at what each tag does, a list is here at [#Tags Extended](/docs/category/tags-extended).
