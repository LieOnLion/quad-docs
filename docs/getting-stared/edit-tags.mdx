## Making a Datapack

To add any kind of item, block or enchantment to their respective tags, you first need a Datapack.

There are a multitude of tutorials you can watch, but I recommend this one by [Legitimoose](https://www.youtube.com/@Legitimoose).

## Actually Editing Tags

### The Basics

All Quad tags are under the "name space" of `quad:`. Create a folder called `tags`, making a path of `data/quad/tags/`. In the `tags` folder you can create the respective folders for what you wish to add.

- For block tags create a folder called `blocks`
- For item tags create a folder called `items`
- For enchantment tags create a folder called `enchantment`

When you see a `/` slash in a path, it means its a new folder, tag files will only contain letters, numbers or `_` underscores, and anything before a `:` colon would be the "name space" (e.g. `quad:<tag_path>`)

```text title=" example_tag.json"
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": [
    "minecraft:example_item_1",
    "minecraft:example_item_2"
  ]
}
```

Here is an `example_tag`. Find a tag you want to edit in [#List of Tags](/getting-stared/list-of-tags), I will choose `immune/fire`. For my tag, `immune/` is another folder, so we need to create that in `quad/tags/items`. When in the correct path, create a new file, name it the tag you wish (in my case `fire`) and end it with `.json`. This is important.

Hover over the `example_tag` code and you should see a copy button, paste it into the new file.

`minecraft:` is the "name space" or "mod id", and `example_item` is the "item id". For items and blocks you can see the "name space" and "item id" in the inventory with `advanced tooltips` (shown with f3 + h).
For enchantments, the "item id" is (usually) the name, e.g. `minecraft:fire_aspect`. (you can see the full list of enchantments with `/enchant @s`)

Each new `value` needs to be seperated with a `,` comma, with the last value ending without one.

### More Advanced

Remove the line `"replace": false,` to remove any other mods/datapacks adding items to the tag, only items in your file will be applied.

Adding items in other tags can be done by putting a `#` hashtag before the "name space", e.g. `#minecraft:planks`. However, usually you would want to add a little extra safety with adding other tags.

```text title=" example_tag_2.json"
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": [
    {
      "id": "#minecraft:example_tag",
      "required": false
    },
    "minecraft:example_item_3",
    "minecraft:example_item_4"
  ]
}
```

With this, `example_item` from `1-4` will have the tag, `1-2` loaded from the first `example_tag`. If for any reason `example_tag` doesn't exist or has an error, `example_item`, `3` and `4` will still be loaded into the tag and `example_tag` will be ignored.
