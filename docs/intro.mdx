# Welcome to Quad

## What is a Quad?

Quad is a mod that adds functional tags for items, blocks and enchantments to Minecraft.

These tags range from what blocks make Cats want to sit on, to what enchantments protect you from burning on Magma Blocks, to even adding Ender Masks.

You can see the full list of tags here: [#List of Tags](/docs/intro#list-of-tags)

## How to edit Tags

To add any kind of item, block or enchantment to their respective tags, you first need a Datapack.

There are a multitude of tutorials you can watch, but I recommend this one by [Legitimoose](https://www.youtube.com/@Legitimoose). 

:::danger Don't need Mc Functions

Stop as he starts making mc-functions, we will not be using them.
And we don't need the mc-functions extention

All Quad tags are under the "name space" of `quad:`. Create a folder called `tags`, making a path of `data/quad/tags/`. In the `tags` folder you can create the respective folders for what you wish to add.

- For block tags create a folder called `blocks`
- For item tags create a folder called `items`
- For enchantment tags create a folder called `enchantment`

When you see a `/` slash in a path, it means its a new folder, tag files will only contain letters, numbers or `_` underscores, and anything before a `:` colon would be the "name space" (e.g. `quad:<tag_path>`)

```text title=" example_tag.json"
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": [
    "minecraft:example_item_1",
    "minecraft:example_item_2"
  ]
}
```

Here is an `example_tag`. Make it as any tag listed below, making sure it has the correct path. When in the correct path, create a new file, name it the tag you wish and end it with `.json`. This is important.

Hover over the `example_tag` code and you should see a copy button, paste it into the new file.

`minecraft:` is the "name space" or "mod id", and `example_item` is the "item id". For items and blocks you can see the "name space" and "item id" in the inventory with `advanced tooltips` (shown with f3 + h).
For enchantments, the "item id" is (usually) the name, e.g. `minecraft:fire_aspect`. Each new `value` needs to be seperated with a `,` comma, with the last value ending without one.

### More Advanced

Remove the line `"replace": false,` to remove any other mods/datapacks adding items to the tag, only items in your file will be applied.

Adding items in other tags can be done by putting a `#` hashtag before the "name space", e.g. `#minecraft:planks`. However, usually you would want to add a little extra safty with adding other tags.

```text title=" example_tag_2.json"
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": [
    {
      "id": "#minecraft:example_tag",
      "required": false
    },
    "minecraft:example_item_3",
    "minecraft:example_item_4"
  ]
}
```

With this, `example_item` from `1-4` will have the tag, `1-2` loaded from the first `example_tag`. If for any reason `example_tag` doesn't exist or has an error, `example_item`, `3` and `4` will still be loaded into the tag and `example_tag` will be ignored.
